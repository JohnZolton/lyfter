# [Lyfter](https://lyfter.vercel.app/): Workout Tracker/Coaching App

This is a powerful workout tracking and coaching application, inspired by the match-or-beat algorithm used by Renaissance Periodization for workout progression and planning. It is built using a robust technology stack that emphasizes type safety.

## Tech Stack
This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
- **Next.js**: Used as the React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **React**: Used for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Used for writing typed JavaScript at any scale.
- **tRPC**: An end-to-end typesafe API layer.
- **Clerk**: Used for user authentication (analogous to NextAuth).
- **Prisma**: Used as the open-source database ORM.
- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework.

## Features

- **Workout Management**: Users can create, plan, edit, and log their workouts with ease.
- **Progress Monitoring**: The app keeps track of users' progress and sends alerts when performance declines.
- **Missed Workouts Handling**: The app handles missed workouts gracefully, ensuring users can get back on track without any hassle.
- **Customization**: Use our premade plan or create your own
- **Target Display**: Displays target weight and reps for each exercise, making it easy for users to understand their goals.
- **Add & Remove**: Users can easily add and remove sets, exercises, and workouts.
- **User Experience**: The app is designed with a clean, easy-to-use interface, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Emphasis on Type Safety

We emphasize type-safe development practices in this project. TypeScript is used throughout the application to ensure types are checked during compile time. Furthermore, tRPC is employed to maintain end-to-end type safety in our API layer.
