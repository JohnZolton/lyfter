This is a bodybuilding exercise tracker. Heavily inspired by Renaissance Periodization and Dr. Mike Israetel. This app will use their "match-or-beat" progression system, where your goal is to exceed the previous weeks workout in either weight, reps or both. Until you can't, and then its time for a deload (rest week). 



Users will be able to:
- create workouts
- create exercises
- log weight, reps and sets
- see their previous weeks workout
- see their target weight and reps for each set in their session
- be warned when their performance is decreasing
- should they miss a day, choose between skipping or shifting the entire workout queue
